Creating a movie recommendation system using Python typically involves using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering techniques. In this description, I'll provide an overview of a simple movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering with the MovieLens dataset and the Surprise library in Python.

This is a basic collaborative filtering recommendation system using the Surprise library. You can enhance the system by exploring content-based filtering, hybrid methods, or using more sophisticated algorithms. Additionally, consider using a larger dataset for better performance.
